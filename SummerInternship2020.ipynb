The raw sequence data (fastq files) for the SARS-CoV-2 infections were downloaded from GEO [GSE147507](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE147507)), including their corresponding Mock-treated controls).

I selected the transcriptomic data (gene expression), taking raw FASTQ files of the sequenced of mock and virus infected tissues. I analyzed this sequences to understand how genes are expressed in these three different tissues infected with the coronaviruses. Differences in gene expression are useful to understand how samples are comparable to each other; however, the downside to gene expression patters is the thousands of genes and how to sort through manually. I used Principal Component Analysis - a dimensionality reduction method to help with the cleaning and analysis. "
