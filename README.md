In this study, we will analyze the gene expression differnt coronaviruses (CoVs) infections to determine how each virus differs when causing a disease. Here, we focuses the analysis on samples from SARS-CoV-1, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2.  The raw sequence data (fastq files) for the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS infections were downloaded from GEO [GSE56192](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56192), including their corresponding Mock-treated controls). The raw sequence data (fastq files) for the SARS-CoV-2 infections were downloaded from GEO ([GSE147507](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE147507)), including their corresponding Mock-treated controls).   In this Jupyter notebook, I will use both R and Python to analyze three viruses: MERS, SARS-CoV-1, amd SARS-CoV-2
